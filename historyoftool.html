<p><strong>Welcome to the ToolBox,Your source for everything Tool related.</strong></p>
<p> This page is dedicated to the history of Tool.</p>
<p>Tool started in 1991 when Keenan and guitarist Jones started practicing together. Tom Morello introduced them to drummer Danny Carey, who lived in the building where they practiced, and he soon joined as well. Bass guitar player Paul D'Amour was the last to join the band. D'Amour left the band in 1995 to work with other bands. Justin Chancellor was hired to replace him.Tool made its first album in 1992. It was called Opiate EP. To help sell records, they went on tour. 
  They traveled around the U.S. playing in concerts with two other bands named Fishbone and Rage Against the Machine. During one of their concerts in 1993, the band was playing at the Church of Scientology’s Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles. Keenan (who would later write the lyrics "Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones"), baa-ed like a sheep for a lot of the show.The album did not sell many copies at first. After Tool got more popular, more fans bought Opiate. It took 13 years for the album to be certified platinum by the RIAA. That means the album sold one million copies.Tool's first studio album came out in 1993. It was called Undertow. In 1994, the band released a song, titled "Prison Sex", from the album. With it was a music video that was created and directed by Jones.With the release of Tool's follow-up single "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: "It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his "surrealistic interpretation" of the subject matter. <p>While some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as "metaphoric",the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene,and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings. The video was deemed It was certified gold by the RIAA after only eight months, and platinum less than a year later.In October 1996, the band released their second studio album, called Ænima. Tool began a long legal fight with their label Volcano Records (formerly Zoo Records) over problems with their contract. They ended up with a new contract that said they would make three more albums.The members of Tool decided to take some time away after that.The album was certified gold in 10 weeks and achieved double platinum, which means it sold two million copies, in 10 months.In 1998, "Ænema" won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.
In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. According to Carey, D'Armour left the band because he wanted to play guitar rather than bass.[27] Justin Chancellor, a member of former tourmates Peach, eventually replaced D'Amour, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss's Scott Reeder, Filter's Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus's E. Shepherd Stevenson, Jane's Addiction's Eric Avery and ZAUM's Marco Fox.
