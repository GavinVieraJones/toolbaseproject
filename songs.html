<p>10,000 days part 2 is written to Judith Marie, Maynard's mom. She was paralyzed for 27 years, or 10,000 days, but you already know all that.
This song serves two purposes: 1. As a eulogy to his mother and 2. as a way to call attention to the hypocrisy within the christian church. Judith was heavily religious and dedicated her life to God despite her being paralyzed. Maynard calls her a savior in herself because she is the only one, it seems, in the christian faith to follow the teachings so devotedly. He also says that the rest of the "ingorant sinners" are lost without her. The song also includes an account of what it would be like as Judith approaches the gates of ST. Peter. </p>

<p>46 & 2 refers to chromosomes. A regular human has 46. Someone who has 46 & 2 reaches the Christ Consciousness. Essentially it is a sort of enlighten state. It allows a human to evolve to the next leveling being. The song is basically about trying to reach this state. Most of the lines refer to this struggle. he term Muscle Memory refers to genes and genetic history. The shadow is part of your self image. It based on a Carl Jung theory. The old armor is his body. So the chorus is basically him saying I am looking into myself for the path and will help me leave this body/state of being.</p>

<p>Prison Sex is a commonly agreed upon osng, meaning-wise.It is generally regarded that the song is about child abuse, specifically of a sexual nature, but the song's theme of the cycle of violence can be applied to almost any type of abuse. The abused grows up to become the abuser. The 'prison' in question is clearly metaphorical.Considering the artist's well known disdain for religion, and the references in the song such as "I am your witness," "my lamb and martyr," and "only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind," I began to reconsider the song from a religious perspective. From this viewpoint, the lyric "I'm treading water" can be seen as a resistance to baptism and acceptance of religion in general.The "sodomy" in question is also a metaphor, and refers to how people use their position of authority over young impressionable children to force their religious beliefs on them while they are still too immature to consider all factors and make up their mind for themselves. They, in turn, do the same to their own children - "do unto others, what has been done to me," a reference to Luke 6:31.</p>
